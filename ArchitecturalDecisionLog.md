# Architectural Decision Log for **Visionize**

- An architecture decision log (**ADL**) is the collection of all ADRs created and maintained for a particular project (or organization).

- An architectural decision record (**ADR**) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. 

- An architecture decision (**AD**) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.

This file isn't the formal document mentioned above, but it's similiar. I'm also really fond of the name "Architectural Decision Record", which gives it that extra level of sophistication.

This is simply the documentation for the process of building the project. This is like my `journey.md` files that come with my previous projects, but this time I will also explain the rationale behind certain choices and design decisions made while making this project.

I've really start to recognize the full worth of (appreciate) documentation, especially ones like ADR that facilitate the [onboarding process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding).
