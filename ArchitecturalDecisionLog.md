# Architectural Decision Log for **Visionize**

***My aim in writing this document was to share the positive impact it made on me with you.***

- An architecture decision log (**ADL**) is the collection of all ADRs created and maintained for a particular project (or organization).

- An architectural decision record (**ADR**) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. 

- An architecture decision (**AD**) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.

This file isn't the formal document mentioned above, but it's similiar. I'm also really fond of the name "Architectural Decision Record", which gives it that extra level of sophistication.

This is simply the documentation for the process of building the project. This is like my `journey.md` files that come with my previous projects, but this time I will also explain the rationale behind certain choices and design decisions made while making this project.

I've really start to recognize the full worth of (appreciate) documentation, especially ones like ADR that facilitate the [onboarding process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding). 

Here are some links if you are interested in learning more about ADR:

With that out of the way, let's move on to development.

## Discussion on why each tech was used

- Next.js 14 App Router is my new favorite way to create front-end applications.

  - [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14) released around Oct. 2023, yet my previous projects only used Next.js 13. 
  - I wanted to incorporate its latest features such as: *partial prerendering* and *server actions*.

- Tailwind CSS is another favorite choice, I prefer the ease of styling and responsive design.

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) has become ny favorite collection of re-usable components
  - We can build our own component system and not be dependent on any 3rd party npm library which needs to be updated and maintained.
