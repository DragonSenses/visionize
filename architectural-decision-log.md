# Architectural Decision Log for **Visionize**

***My aim in writing this document was to share the positive impact it made on me with you.***

- An architecture decision log (**ADL**) is the collection of all ADRs created and maintained for a particular project (or organization).

- An architectural decision record (**ADR**) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. 

- An architecture decision (**AD**) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.

This file isn't the formal document mentioned above, but it's similiar. I'm also really fond of the name "Architectural Decision Record", which gives it that extra level of sophistication.

This is simply the documentation for the process of building the project. This is like my `journey.md` files that come with my previous projects, but this time I will also explain the rationale behind certain choices and design decisions made while making this project.

I've really start to recognize the full worth of (appreciate) documentation, especially ones like ADR that facilitate the [onboarding process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding). 

Here are some links if you are interested in learning more about ADR:

With that out of the way, let's move on to development.

## Discussion on tech design choices

- Next.js 14 App Router is my new favorite way to create front-end applications.

  - [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14) released around Oct. 2023, yet my previous projects only used Next.js 13. 
  - I wanted to incorporate its latest features such as: *partial prerendering* and *server actions*.

- Tailwind CSS is another favorite choice, I prefer the ease of styling and responsive design.

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) has become ny favorite collection of re-usable components
  - We can build our own component system and not be dependent on any 3rd party npm library which needs to be updated and maintained.

## Coding style & naming conventions

Here I'd like to list out some general rules I'd like to set for myself to ensure consistent coding style and naming conventions. I'll be updating this section intermittently.

Enforcing these rules keeps the codebase consistent and reduces overhead when thinking about how to name files and variables.

### Coding Style

- Favor vertical code hierarchy over horizontal

### Naming Conventions

In this React, Typescript project here is some rules to adhere to:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Case</td>
    <td>Subject</td>
    <td>Example</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>camelCase (start with lowercase letter and capitalizes the first letter of each subsequent word)</td>
    <td>Code: variables, functions, objects, etc.</td>
    <td>someVariable, doSomething, myId</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PascalCase (Uppercase with no separators, first letter must be uppercase)</td>
    <td>Components</td>
    <td>App, Layout, Navbar, CardList </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>kebab-case (lowercase words separated by hypens)</td>
    <td>File names that are NOT components</td>
    <td>pages, API routes, utils, etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Square brackets ([ ])</td>
    <td>Dynamic route segments</td>
    <td>[id], [slug], [boardId], etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Underscore ( _ )</td>
    <td>Special files, or private properties</td>
    <td>_app, _document, _error, etc.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Project configuration

Let's get started with [Next.js 14 - App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs).

- [Nextjs Installation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest visionize
```

Now we answer the prompts that defines the set up of our project

```sh
√ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... No / [Yes]
√ Would you like to use ESLint? ... No / [Yes]
√ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... No / [Yes]
√ Would you like to use `src/` directory? ... [No] / Yes
√ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... No / [Yes]
√ Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? ... [No] / Yes
```

Initialize Next.js 14 project

- This commit sets up the basic structure and configuration for a nextjs 14 project with the following setup:
- Typescript, ESLint, TailwindCSS
- App Router

The next step is to initialize [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next).

```sh
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

This should give us the following prompts

```sh
Need to install the following packages:
  shadcn-ui@0.6.0
Ok to proceed? (y) y
√ Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)? ... no / *yes*
√ Which style would you like to use? » *Default*
√ Which color would you like to use as base color? » *Neutral*
√ Where is your global CSS file? ... *app/globals.css*
√ Would you like to use CSS variables for colors? ... no / *yes*
√ Are you using a custom tailwind prefix eg. tw-? (Leave blank if not) ...
√ Where is your tailwind.config.js located? ... *tailwind.config.ts*
√ Configure the import alias for components: ... *@/components*
√ Configure the import alias for utils: ... *@/lib/utils*
√ Are you using React Server Components? ... no / *yes*
√ Write configuration to components.json. Proceed? ... *yes*
```

Initialize shadcn-ui@0.6.0

Let's take a closer look at the `/lib/utils.ts` file that `shadcn/ui` installed. Going to add comments to describe `utils.ts` and the `cn` function that it contains.

The `cn()` function allows us to safely combine and merge tailwind classes. Useful for applying both conditional and merged class names to a React component or element. e.g., we may have a specific class for a `success` state, and another class for the `error` state.

```ts
/* A utility function that combines clsx and tailwind-merge to create a single
string of class names */
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
/* twMerge is a function that takes one or more strings of Tailwind CSS 
classes and returns a single string of merged classes, following the 
Tailwind CSS rules. twMerge is useful for combining and overriding class 
names from different sources, such as props, state, or theme */
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

/**
 * Export the cn helper function, which takes one or more ClassValue arguments
 * and returns a single string of merged class names. Useful for applying both
 * conditional and merged class names to a React component or element.
 * @param inputs ClassValue is a type that represents a valid CSS class name
 * @returns a single string of merged classnames
 */
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  // Use clsx to convert the inputs to a single string of class names
  // Use twMerge to merge the class names according to the Tailwind CSS rules
  // Return the merged string of class names
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

### Developing the app

Start with the `globals.css`, and set all `html`, `body` and `:root` elements to 100% of the viewport height.

`app\globals.css`
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

html,
body,
:root {
  height: 100%;
}

@layer base {
  :root {
    --background: 0 0% 100%;
    --foreground: 0 0% 3.9%;

/* ... */
```

Some Next.js app router features:

- [Pages and Layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts)
- [Route Groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups)
- [Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes)
- [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route)
  - [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers)

Let's look at the entry point to our application, the home page. We'll remove the boilerplate that it shipped with and keep it simple, a `Home` component that returns a `div`.

`app\page.tsx`
```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="text-sky-500">
      Visionize
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Landing Page

Better yet, we should create an organizational folder named `(landing)` and move the `page.tsx` in there. Next rename the function to `LandingPage`.

`app\(landing)\page.tsx`
```tsx
import React from 'react';

export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <div>page</div>
  )
}
```

A landing page is a standalone web page that is created for a specific marketing or advertising campaign. It has a single goal or call to action, such as capturing leads or making sales.

A marketing page is a more general term that can refer to any web page that is used to promote a product, service, or brand. A marketing page can have multiple goals or links, such as providing information, building trust, or directing visitors to other page.

A landing page is a type of marketing page, but not all marketing pages are landing pages. For example, a homepage is a marketing page that showcases a brand and its offerings, but it is not a landing page because it does not have a specific campaign goal or a clear call to action. A landing page, on the other hand, is designed to persuade visitors to take one action, such as signing up for a free trial, downloading an ebook, or buying a product.

Next, create a specific layout for the `LandingPage`. Create `layout.tsx` inside `(landing)`, a `LandingLayout` component which accepts a `children` prop that will be populated with a child page.

`app\(landing)\layout.tsx`
```tsx
const LandingLayout = ({
  children
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

export default LandingLayout;
```

Next let's give the `LandingLayout` some styles, `h-full` and `bg-slate-100`. Wrap the `children` in a `<main>` with the same background color, and padding for both the top and bottom side. The padding is there for the components `Navbar` and `Footer` that we will add later, for now we'll add comments to mark as indicators for where it should be.

`app\(landing)\layout.tsx`
```tsx
const LandingLayout = ({
  children
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) => {
  return (
    <div className="h-full bg-slate-100">
      {/* Navbar */}
      <main className="pt-40 pb-20 bg-slate-100">
        {children}
      </main>
      {/* Footer */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default LandingLayout;
```

Let's develop the `LandingPage`.

- Center the contents inside the element using `flex-col`
- Add a `Medal` icon from `lucide-react`
- Add some text right under that

`app\(landing)\page.tsx`
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Medal } from 'lucide-react';

export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <div className='flex items-center justify-center flex-col'>
      <div className='flex items-center justify-center flex-col'>
        <div>
          <Medal className='h-6 w-6 mr-2'/>
          Achieve more with <strong><em>Visionize</em></strong>, the ultimate task management app
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Instead of a catch-phrase, let's change it to a badge. Reduce the text to something shorter. Let's also style the innermost `div` with some amber coloring, box shadow and slightly rounded corners. Switch the icons up to symbolically represent what the app is clsoer too.

`lucide-react` has icons for `Kanban`, this better conveys the purpose of the app.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ClipboardCheck, KanbanSquare } from 'lucide-react';

export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <div className='flex items-center justify-center flex-col'>
      <div className='flex items-center justify-center flex-col'>
        <div className='mb-4 flex items-center border shadow-sm p-4 bg-amber-100 text-amber-700 rounded-full uppercase'>
          <KanbanSquare className='h-6 w-6 mr-2'/>
          <span className='mr-1'><strong>Visionize</strong></span> your tasks
          <ClipboardCheck className='h-6 w-6 mx-2'/>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```
